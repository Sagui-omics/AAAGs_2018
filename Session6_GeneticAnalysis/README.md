#### Molecular genetic and genomic analysis of gene variants

##### Workshop:
1. Everyone should set up an account on pythonanywhere.com to execute code.
2. This is an interactive and guided workshop in three parts.
  - Introduction
  - Part 1. Source of variation and innovation.
  - Part 2. Molecular genetic and genomic modeling of mutations.

##### Learning Objectives:
After attending this workshop, you will be able to:
1. Explain how mutations are sources of variation in evolution & development.
2. Identify features in SNP variants using bioinformatic data mining techniques.

##### Prerequisites:
1. Create a free account on http://www.pythonanywhere.com
2. Under Accounts, click the "teacher" tab and add "**rah**"" as your teacher.

##### Background:
1. Multicellular organisms are a form of complex life which develop from a single cell zygote to adult, under the control of the same DNA genome. Basic processes include:
  - cell proliferation
  - differentiation of cells into types
  - all cells use the same genome with possibly some epigenetic changes

2. The evolution of development studies how genomic mutations affect the changes in cellular complexity under stabilizing selection. For example, how do organisms evolve:
  - innovative and/or adaptive traits
  - increased mutational variation
  - genetic network robustness against perturbation

##### Methods:
- We will characterize how different mutations in genes affect the evolution of robustness in genomes of multicellular organisms with:
  - Mathematical models of genome mutations affecting the levels at which genes are expressed
  - Rule based modeling of mutations affecting a protein molecular structure

### Part 1. Source of variation and innovation:
* Slides - How mutation leads to genetic diversity.
* Interactive gene regulatory network dynamics in python.
* Sequence analysis; how to get and use public genomic data.
* Web resources for TRANSFAC analysis, PhyloPrint, & UCSC Genome Browser.

### Part 2. Molecular genetic and genomic modeling of mutations:
* Slides - From structure to function and phenotype.
* Interactive rule-based modeling of molecular species and regulatory dynamics.
* Sequence analysis; generating TF-binding motifs and word logos, identification of protein motifs, and scanning sequence for a known 1D motif.
* Web resources for Gene Ontology, Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, & GWAS Central.
